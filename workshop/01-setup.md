# Part 1: Setup & Context Engineering

[📚 Lab Guide](https://copilot-dev-days.github.io/agent-lab-python/docs/) • [← Overview](00-overview.md)

> ⏱️ **Time:** ~15 minutes

In this section, you'll set up your development environment and teach GitHub Copilot about your codebase.

---

## 🔧 Initial Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Own Repository (required)

1. Open [github.com/copilot-dev-days/agent-lab-python](https://github.com/copilot-dev-days/agent-lab-python)
2. Click **Use this template** → **Create a new repository**
   - Name: `my-soc-ops-python`
   - Visibility: **Public**
3. ✅ Your own Soc Ops repo is ready!

### Step 2: Choose How to Open Your Repository

This repo includes a ready-to-use devcontainer (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`), so you can work locally or in Codespaces.

#### Option A: Clone & Open in Local VS Code

1. Open VS Code
2. Run command: `Git: Clone` → `Clone from GitHub`
3. Select your new repository
4. When prompted, install **recommended extensions**

#### Option B: Open Your New Repo in GitHub Codespaces

1. Open your newly created repository on GitHub
2. Click **Code** → **Codespaces** → **Create codespace on main**
3. Wait for setup to finish (the devcontainer runs `uv sync` automatically)
4. ✅ You can start the lab directly in the browser-based VS Code experience

### Step 3: Run the Setup Agent (both options)

In the Chat panel:

```
/setup
```

The agent will:
- Detect your environment
- Install any missing dependencies
- Start the development server

> ⚠️ **Codespace in the browser:** If you're running the app inside a GitHub Codespace via the browser (not VS Code Desktop), styles and interactions (e.g. the Start Game button) may not work correctly due to private port authentication. To fix this, either:
> 1. In the **Ports** panel (bottom bar), right-click port `8000` → **Port Visibility** → **Public**
> 2. Or open the Codespace in **VS Code Desktop** instead (click the hamburger menu `☰` → **Open in VS Code Desktop**)

✅ **Success:** App is running in your browser!

## 📚 Understanding Context Engineering

Context engineering is how you teach AI about your specific codebase. This makes Copilot's suggestions more accurate and relevant.

### Task 1: Generate Workspace Instructions

Instructions guide all agentic interactions, making them efficient and reliable.

**Steps:**

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run: `Chat: Generate Agent Instructions`
2. Wait for the agent to analyze your codebase
3. Review the generated instructions (probably too detailed!)
4. Follow up with:
   ```
   Compress down by half and add a mandatory development checklist 
   (lint, build, test) to the top
   ```
5. **Commit** the instructions file

✅ **Result:** All future requests have a basic map of your workspace.

### Task 2: Copilot CLI and Cloud Agents for Parallel Work

Copilot CLI sessions run in isolated git worktrees, which is perfect for tasks that don't need handholding.

> 💡 **Three UI controls to know:**
> - **New session (`+`)** (top of the Chat panel) — create a **New Chat**, **New Chat Editor**, **New Chat Window**, or **New Copilot CLI Session**
> - **Chat mode dropdown** (bottom-left of the chat input, shows **Agent** by default) — pick a mode (**Agent**, **Ask**, **Plan**) or a custom agent
> - **Session type dropdown** (bottom-left of the chat input, shows **Local** by default) — hand off or run in a different environment: **Local**, **Copilot CLI**, or **Cloud**

**Start a Copilot CLI session:**

1. In the **session type dropdown** (bottom-left, shows **Local**), select **Copilot CLI**
2. Enter:
   ```
   Add linting rules with ruff for unused vars and type hints; fix any errors
   ```
3. Let it run, then **Review** and **Apply** the changes
4. Right-click the session to delete it when done

**Start a Cloud Agent or Copilot CLI session:**

> **If you have Copilot Pro, Business, or Enterprise:**
>
> 1. In the **session type dropdown** (bottom-left), select **Cloud**
> 2. Enter:
>    ```
>    Make the README more engaging as a landing page to the project
>    ```

> **If you're on the free tier (no Cloud access):**
>
> 1. In the **session type dropdown** (bottom-left), select **Copilot CLI**
> 2. Enter:
>    ```
>    Make the README more engaging as a landing page to the project
>    ```

✅ **Result:** Linting rules added, errors fixed, README improved -- all without interrupting your main workspace!

### Task 3: Explore Existing Instructions

Your repo comes with pre-configured instructions that help the AI understand the project.

#### CSS Utilities Instructions

📄 See `.github/instructions/css-utilities.instructions.md`

These document the custom CSS utility classes available in this Python/Jinja2 project.

> 💡 **Optional:** Delete the main text and re-run the prompt to see how it generates

#### Frontend Design Instructions

📄 See `.github/instructions/frontend-design.instructions.md`

The "no purple gradients" instructions challenge the agent to think like a designer.

> 💡 **Think about:** What other AI biases could you challenge and nudge?
